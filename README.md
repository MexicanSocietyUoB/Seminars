The template for the website is based on [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)


Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme. Perfect for hosting your personal site, blog, or portfolio on GitHub or self-hosting on your own server. As the name implies --- styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you :smile:.


:sparkles: Minimal Mistakes is now available as a [Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/minimal-mistakes-jekyll). Consult the [Quick-Start Guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/) and [this blog post](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/jekyll/gemified-theme-beta/) to learn how to upgrade.
