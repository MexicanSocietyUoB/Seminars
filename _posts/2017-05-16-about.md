The science seminars are aimed for those students who want to talk about their
pioneering work to a general audience at the University of Birmingham.
For the first edition of the seminars, two talks per month are going to be given
during the 2017 Autumn term.
Additionally, this space has the purpose to create a network for both the
previous and the current Mexican students at University of Birmingham
to let anyone know about what we are doing, which topics are investigating
and where to contact each of the members.

> The Mexican Community at University of Birmingham believe that #AnotherMexicoIsOnHisHerWay. #OtroMexicoSeRespira
