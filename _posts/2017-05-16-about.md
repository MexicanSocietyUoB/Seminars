The science seminars of the Mexican society at the University of Birmingham 
are aimed for students and researchers who want to talk about their 
pioneering research in an enthusiastic, engaging and provocative 
presentation for a general audience.

This website has the primarily purpose to openly share 
information about the research areas in which Mexicans are contributing 
to the advance of knowledge and proving the contact point for the speakers.
We are encouraging the scientific community to work towards a reproducible 
and open science where anyone, anywhere can get the benefits of science.

Additionally to that, if you have a conference presentation coming up, or are
working on a paper or other research idea that you would like to give a
presentation on or get feedback about, please feel free to volunteer to
give a talk to our friendly audience.
