title: "Science Seminars of the Mexican Society"
---

The Mexican Society at University of Birmingham has created this space
to engage with the community in Birmingham, UK. Essentially, this space is for
those students who want to present their work in the seminar. Another
purpose for the seminars is to create an echo in Mexico and anywhere
in the work to let them known what we are doing, who is doing what and
how we can contact the members.
