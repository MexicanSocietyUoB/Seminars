The science seminars are aimed for students and researchers who want to talk
about their pioneering research to a general audience at the University of Birmingham.
So, if you have a conference presentation coming up, or are
working on a paper or other research idea you would like to give a
presentation on or get feedback about, please feel free to volunteer to
give a talk to our friendly audience!

Additionally to that, this space has the purpose to create a network for both
previous and current Mexican students at University of Birmingham.
We want to provide information about the areas of research in which
Mexicans are contributing to the advance of knowledge and proving
the contact point for the members of the Mexican Society.

We are also encouraging the community to work towards a reproducible and open
science where anyone, anywhere can get the benefits of science.

For the first edition of the seminars, two talks per month will be
presented during the Autumn 2017. This year, 2018, we will have very interesting
speakers, [check out!](https://mexicansocietyuob.github.io/seminars/seminars/talks/talks2018/)

> The members of the Mexican Community at University of Birmingham believe
that #AnotherMexicoIsOnHisHerWay. #OtroMexicoSeRespira
