The science seminars are aimed for students and researchers who want to talk
about their pioneering research to a general audience at the University of Birmingham.
For the first edition of the seminars, two talks per month will be
presented during the Autumn 2017.

Additionally to that, this space has the purpose to create a network for both the
previous and the current Mexican students at University of Birmingham.
We also want to provide information about the areas of research in which
Mexicans are contributing to the advance of knowledge and also proving
the contact point for the members of the Mexican Society.

> The members of the Mexican Community at University of Birmingham believe
that #AnotherMexicoIsOnHisHerWay. #OtroMexicoSeRespira
