title: "General Information for Speakers"
---

As a speaker for the Science Seminars of the Mexican Society,
we are kindly inviting you to share your research advances in an
enthusiastic, engaging and provocative talk for a general audience.
With this in mind, we essentially require you to share the following information
before your talk:
(1) an short abstract, (2) keywords, (3) a 20-minute presentation
and (4) a short biography.

Our goal with the Science Seminars is sharing to the international and to the
Mexican community what the students of University of Birmingham are doing in
their areas of research.  
We are also encouraging the community to work towards a reproducible and open
science where anyone, anywhere can get the benefits of Science

## Requirements

##### (1) Abstract

**Abstract** of approximately 150 word. In case that you require a bit of
inspiration for writing your abstract, you can visit the following instructions
that provide a good example of a well written and structured abstract.

##### (2) Keywords
Provide from three to five keywords going from general to specific areas of your research.

##### (3) Title of the presentation
Try to put a bit of imagination and create a provocative title.
We want that our audience feel the power of science and the creation of new knowledge.

##### (4) Presentation
The presentation should be 20 minutes followed by 10
minutes questions. The presentation is in English language and is targeted for a
general audience.
If possible, the presentation should cover introduction to the topic highlighting
the novelty and contribution to knowledge, the methodology used in the research,
results and conclusions.

Your presentation is going to be available in the Science Seminar's
website for which we require that your content is under the creative commons licence.

We suggest to read these references to structure your presentation

##### (5) Short Biography
Create a short biography of maximum 200 words. We also encourage you to share your
contact details such as Webpage, twitter, Facebook, github or e-mail.
It would be nice if you have a photo to add you in the data base of the presenters.

Some tips for a short biography are: Use formal style; Tailor it for a specific occasion;
Be concise; Define yourself in the first sentence and afterwards establish your credentials;
Use clear terminology that your audience will understand; Spell out abbreviations;
Use strong action words to convey your experiences and illustrate your qualifications with phrases
like “Dr. Scientist has a strong background in” and “Dr. Scientist identified
X species for the first time”

##### Video
As long as you agree, you might be video recorded and the video will be upload to
youtube in order to share to our global audience your talk.
