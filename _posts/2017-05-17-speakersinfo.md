## Speakers

As a speaker for the science seminar, we are asking you to provide an abstract
for the presentation, keywords and a short biography.
We invite you to use open software in order to be able to share all our
talks and wake up the curiosity of others.

## Title of the presentation

Try to put a bit of imagination and create a provocative title.
We want that our audience feel the power of science and the creation
of new knowledge.


## Presentation

Prepare a 20 minutes presentation in English language that is targeted for a
general audience of different backgrounds.
Your presentation will be updated in the sites of the seminar so the content
should be under the creative commons licence.

## Abstract


**Abstract** is a feature that displays source code, in different
colors and fonts according to the category of terms. This feature facilitates
writing in a structured language such as a programming language or a markup
language as both structures and syntax errors are visually distinct. Highlighting
does not affect the meaning of the text itself; it is intended only for human
readers.

In case that you require a bit of inspiration, the following instructions describe
very well how to construct an abstract:

## Keywords

Add from three to five keywords going from general to specific areas of your research.


## Video

As long as you agree, you might be recorded to share to our audience the work
you are doing in your research.


## Short Biography

Create a short biography of 100 words. We also encorage you to share your webpage,
twitter, facebook or any way to contact you.
You can also share a personal quote or an author's quote so as to add it on your
profile.
