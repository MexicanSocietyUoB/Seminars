As a speaker for the Science Seminars of the Mexican Society,
we are kindly inviting you to share your research advances in a provocative and
enthusiastic talk for a general audience.
With this in mind, we require you to share the following information: an
abstract, keywords, a 20-minute presentation and a short biography.
Our goal with the Science Seminars is sharing
to the international and to the Mexican community
what the students of University of Birmingham are doing in their areas of research.  
We are also encouraging the community to work towards a reproducible and open
science where anyone, anywhere can get the benefits of doing science.

## Requirements

##### Abstract

**Abstract** of approximately 150 word. In case that you require a bit of
inspiration for writing your abstract, you can visit the following instructions
that provide a good example of a well written and structured abstract.

##### Keywords
Provide from three to five keywords going from general to specific areas of your research.

##### Title of the presentation

Try to put a bit of imagination and create a provocative title.
We want that our audience feel the power of science and the creation
of new knowledge.

##### Presentation
Prepare a 20-minutes presentation in English language that is targeted for a
general audience. Your presentation will be available in the Science Seminar's
website to which the content should be under the creative commons licence.

We suggest to read these references to structure your presentation

##### Short Biography

Create a short biography of maximum 200 words. We also encourage you to share your
contact details such as Webpage, twitter, Facebook or e-mail. It would be nice if
you have a photo to add you in the data base of the presenters.

Some tips for a short biography are: Use formal style; Tailor it for a specific occasion;
Be concise; Define yourself in the first sentence and afterwards establish your credentials;
Use clear terminology that your audience will understand; Spell out abbreviations;
Use strong action words to convey your experiences and illustrate your qualifications with phrases
like “Dr. Scientist has a strong background in” and “Dr. Scientist identified
X species for the first time”

As long as you agree, you might be video recorded and upload a youtube video
