title: "General Information for Speakers"
---

Our goal with the Science Seminars is sharing to the international and 
to the Mexican community what the students of University of Birmingham 
are doing in their areas of research.
We are encouraging the community to work towards a reproducible and open
science where anyone, anywhere can get the benefits of Science.

As a speaker of the Science Seminars of the Mexican Society,
we are kindly inviting you to share your research advances in an
enthusiastic, engaging and provocative talk for a general audience.
We essentially require you to share the following information
before your talk:
* (1) Title of the talk.
* (2) a short abstract of the talk (maximum 150 words),
* (3) three keywords,
* (4) a short biography (maximum 200 words).
* (5) a 20-minute presentation in PDF, and

# Requirements

## (1) Title of the talk
Put a bit of imagination and create a provocative title.
We want that our audience feel the power of science and the creation of new knowledge.

## (2) Abstract
We recommend you to write an abstract of approximately 150 word.
[How to construct a Nature summary paragraph](https://github.com/MexicanSocietyUoB/Seminars/blob/master/assets/presentations/Letter_bold_para.pdf)
is a good reference of both well written and well structured abstract.

## (3) Keywords
Provide from three to five keywords going from general to specific areas of your research.

## (4) Short Biography
Create a short biography of maximum 200 words. We also encourage you to share your
contact details such as Webpage, twitter, Facebook, github and e-mail.
This is optional, but it would be nice if you have a photo to add you in the
data base of the presenters.

Some tips for a short biography are: Use formal style; Tailor it for a specific occasion;
Be concise; Define yourself in the first sentence and afterwards establish your credentials;
Use clear terminology that your audience will understand; Spell out abbreviations;
Use strong action words to convey your experiences and illustrate your qualifications with phrases
like “Dr. Scientist has a strong background in” and “Dr. Scientist identified
X species for the first time”
[(Puljak, 2008)](http://www.labtimes.org/labtimes/method/methods/2008_02.lasso).


## (5) Presentation
The presentation should be 20 minutes followed by 10 minutes of questions and answers.
The presentation is in English language and is targeted for a general audience.
If possible, the presentation should cover introduction to the topic highlighting
the novelty and contribution to knowledge, the methodology used in the research,
results and conclusions.

Your presentation is going to be available in the Science Seminar's
[website](https://mexicansocietyuob.github.io/seminars/) for which we require
that the content of your presentation is under the creative commons licence.

We recommend you to read these general points on how to structure your presentation
