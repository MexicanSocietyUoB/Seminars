## Abstract

Salmonella infections account for one million deaths around the world every year. Understanding the mechanisms of protective immunity is vital to aid in the design of new therapies, including vaccines. Platelets are components of the blood that have shown to play a role in the control of infections. In the Salmonella model there is excessive platelet activation and thrombosis. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the potential role of platelets and thrombosis in the containment of Salmonella infection. Results show that a low frequency of thrombi harbours bacteria, and even in the thrombi that contain bacteria, the numbers are very low. This suggests that thrombosis in the context of Salmonella infection may not be playing in a role in the containment of infection. However, the direct effects of platelets in bacteria killing are still under investigation.

## Author

Marisol Perez-Toledo is a research fellow from the Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy 
from the University of Birmingham. She got her Bachelor’s degree in Chemistry, 
Pharmacy and Biology at the Faculty of Chemistry from Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, 
and then her master’s degree from Instituto Politecnico Nacional, 
where she studied the mechanism of immunogenicity of bacterial vaccine adjuvants. 
Finally, she did her PhD in the same institution where she investigated the mechanisms 
of protection induced by an experimental Salmonella vaccine. 
Currently, she is working under [Professor Adam Cunningham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/immunology-immunotherapy/cunningham-adam.aspx)’s 
supervision in investigating the pathology of Salmonella infection in the liver, and how the coagulation 
system contributes to protection against infection.
