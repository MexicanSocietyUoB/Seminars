Cristina Villanueva, a recently graduated PhD in Pure Mathematics, is going
to speak about "Counting to infinity and more in 20 minutes (ish)".

Her presentation is available [here](https://github.com/MexicanSocietyUoB/seminars/blob/master/assets/slides/~/slides.pdf)

## Abstract
The main idea of this talk is to explain the concept of infinity form the
mathematical point of view without assuming (almost) any mathematical background.
Hopefully this would also give a taste of what mathematics are.

## Author
Cristina was born in Mexico City, where she completed her bachelor’s and master’s
degree in mathematics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).
Then she continued her studies in pure mathematics focusing her research in the
area of analysis (in particular she studied Lipschitz quotient mappings on the plane)
under the supervision of [Olga Maleva](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/maths/maleva-olga.aspx).
She has recently finished her PhD in the University of Birmingham and now...
Well, right now she is still surprised that the last sentence is written in past
tense and in the very near future she will be dealing with the tougher question:
what can she do with a PhD in pure mathematics?
Apparently she can, at least, give a talk about infinity.
