Alejandro Vigna-Gomez, third year PhD student in Astrophysics,
talked about "The Death of Starts".

His presentation is available [here](https://github.com/MexicanSocietyUoB/seminars/blob/master/assets/slides/agomezvina102017/MexSocSeminarShort.pdf)

## Abstract
When massive stars end their life they can become either a neutron star or black hole.
In this talk, we go through the basic concepts in astrophysics which allow us to
understand the fate of these massive stars. We start by defining what is a star.
We then describe the evolution of a star until death and how to determine what
will its remnant be. Finally, we comment on an alternative model,
the pair-instability supernova, which leaves no remnant at all.

## Author
Alejandro Vigna-Gómez is originally from San Luis Potosí, Mexico.
He received his bachelor degree in theoretical physics at the U.A.S.L.P.
He is mainly interested in researching about the progenitors of neutron stars
and black holes, single or binary. He is currently doing a PhD in Astrophysics
under the supervision of
[Prof. Ilya Mandel](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/physics/mandel-ilya.aspx).
Additionally to that, he is enthusiastic about football and passionate
about philosophy.
