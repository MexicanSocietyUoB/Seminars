## Abstract
Mycobacterium chelonae is a pathogen that causes infections in humans. 
By doing so, it forms a structure called biofilm, which is a group of bacteria 
that are living within a matrix composed of polymers. 
So far, these structures have not been fully characterized in this bacterium, 
and because its incidence is increasing and it exhibits striking tolerance 
to antimicrobials, it is important to gain knowledge about the components 
and mechanisms responsible for forming biofilms to further contribute 
to the development of therapeutics. My research has shown that 
M. chelonae biofilms are rich in polysaccharides, and exhibit different 
lipids patterns compared to planktonic cultures. Also, analysis of five 
M. chelonae clinical isolates has shown that these strains have different 
colony and biofilm morphologies, and a different lipid patterns 
compared to the type strain.


## Author
Perla Vega Dominguez is a Biochemical Engineer in Food Processing from 
the Instituto Tecnologico de Culiacan (2007-2012).
Perla decided to move into the pharmaceutical biotechnology field, 
so she did a master’s in Productive Biotechnology in the Pharmacy Department in 
CIATEJ (Centro de Investigación y Asistencia en Tecnología y Diseño del Estado de Jalisco) (2012-2014), 
where she started working with mycobacterial biofilms and became passionate about the topic (who wouldn’t?). 
After completing her masters, she decided to pursue a PhD (2015-to date) in order to become an expert 
in mycobacterial research. 
Perla is now using different approaches to characterize M. chelonae biofilms, 
in the research group of [Dr. Apoorva Bhatt](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/biosciences/staff/profile.aspx?ReferenceId=8917) 
from the Institute of Microbiology and Infection in the School of Biosciences.
