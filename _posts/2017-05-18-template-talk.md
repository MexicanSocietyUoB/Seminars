## Abstract

**Syntax highlighting** is a feature that displays source code, in different
colors and fonts according to the category of terms. This feature facilitates
writing in a structured language such as a programming language or a markup
language as both structures and syntax errors are visually distinct. Highlighting
does not affect the meaning of the text itself; it is intended only for human
readers.
