Cecilia did her undergraduate studies in Psychology at the Universidad
Iberoamericana, Mexico. After finishing her studies, she worked for a year at a
school for children diagnosed with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). Then, she
studied an MSc. in Developmental Disorders at Lancaster University under the
supervision of [Professor Gert Westermann](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=LRUPxvAAAAAJ&hl=en)

learn and remember words related to adjectives and object properties.
After finishing her degree, she went back to Mexico where she worked as a preschool

the vocabulary of typically developed infants and infants with language delays.
