Claudia Cecilia Zuñiga Montanez, first year PhD student in Psychology,
talked about how infants learn words and how their vocabulary can be enhanced.

Her presentation is titled as "The acquisition of words during the first years of life"
and it is available [here](https://github.com/MexicanSocietyUoB/seminars/blob/master/assets/slides/czuniga052017/slidespptx.pdf)


## Abstract
When do infants start talking? Which words do they learn first? are the main questions
that Celia is interested to answer. In this presentation, she  presents different bias
methodologies that might affect or improve the way an infant learn a language.
With this in mind, an experiment with 32 infants of 17 months old children
is performed in order to teach infants to focus on either the shape or the function
when learning and generalising novel words. The experiment also asses the effect
the two strategies (learning by shape or learning by function) have in vocabulary growth.
Finally, the results aim to provide information regarding techniques to boost
the vocabulary of typically development children and potentially infants with
language delays.


## Author
Cecilia Zuñiga did her undergraduate studies in Psychology at the Universidad
Iberoamericana, Mexico. After finishing her studies, she worked for a year at a
school for children diagnosed with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). Then, she
studied an MSc. in Developmental Disorders at Lancaster University under the
supervision of [Professor Gert Westermann](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=LRUPxvAAAAAJ&hl=en)
where she worked in the Lancaster University´s Baby Lab studying how infants
learn and remember words related to adjectives and object properties.
After finishing her degree, she went back to Mexico where she worked as a preschool
teacher and as a child therapist for infants diagnosed with language, learning or
developmental disorders. Currently she is doing her PhD in Psychology
under the supervision of [Dr Andrea Krott](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Dqdrwa0AAAAJ&hl=en)
where she is studying infant language development and techniques to boost
the vocabulary of typically developed infants and infants with language delays.
