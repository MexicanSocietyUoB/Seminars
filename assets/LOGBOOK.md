- [ ] contact previous speakers to ask them about the missing information
of their profiles in the website.
> Dear
We have noticed that there are some missing information about your profile
(slides, abstract and bio) in the website of the science seminars of the
Mexican society. Would you be kindly enough to share such information.
We want that the visitors of the website find reliable and useful information


- [ ] Decide where to share the slides of the presentations, the options are:
https://figshare.com/ https://gitpitch.com/,  https://issuu.com/. _(CREATED:13Dec2017 SORTED:DayMonthYear COMMIT(s): )_

- [ ] Create the members site

- [ ] Create google form or doodle form for the speakers. Something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWN4W2aE0Y0)


- [ ] Create a search bar like the one in ciudaddelasideas in order to have the following
bar: SEARCH[]  CATEGORIES[] YEAR[]. This is the example https://www.ciudaddelasideas.com/ponentes.php


- [ ] Explore /docs in the seminars repository

- [ ] Create a gmail account:

MexicanSociety
UniversityOfBirmingham
MexicanSocietyUoB
@gmail.com

I tried to create such account, however the google policies mentioned that each
gmail account has to be linked to a mobile number to which I would not be able
to create the account. just for the record I tried some Online SMS Verification
Sites but none of the work on August 2017 for which I am going to use my
personal gmail account to create the forms for the time slots for the
presenters.
