## Hi Emanuel,

this is a reminder for the your talk in the Science Seminars Series of the
Mexican Society which will be this Friday at the Learning centre at 18h00.
Your presentation should be for around 20 minutes and you will get 10 minutes
for questions.
NB. Bring your presentation in PDF to avoid any problems with the office version
or font and margin configurations.

With regard to your talk, we want that our audience know the quality of the Mexican
science and the creation of new knowledge in many disciplines and, if possible,
we want that you share your research advances in a provocative and enthusiastic
talk to a general audience.
Would you please share me a very short bio in order to present you in the seminar?
