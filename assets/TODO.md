Continue the exploration to make it work on the following links https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1308#issuecomment-337437135


- [ ] Create the members site


- [ ] contact previous speakers and ask them about the information that is presented
in the webpage


- [ ] Add slides show to the website, maybe with https://gitpitch.com/

- [ ] Embed https://issuu.com/ PDF presentations in the posts

- [ ] Create google form or doodle form for the speakers. Something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWN4W2aE0Y0)


- [ ] Create a search bar like the one in ciudaddelasideas in order to have the following
bar: SEARCH[]  CATEGORIES[] YEAR[]. This is the example https://www.ciudaddelasideas.com/ponentes.php


- [ ] Explore /docs in the seminars repository

- [ ] Create a gmail account:

MexicanSociety
UniversityOfBirmingham
MexicanSocietyUoB
@gmail.com

I tried to create such account, however the google policies mentioned that each
gmail account has to be linked to a mobile number to which I would not be able
to create the account. just for the record I tried some Online SMS Verification
Sites but none of the work on August 2017 for which I am going to use my
personal gmail account to create the forms for the time slots for the
presenters.
