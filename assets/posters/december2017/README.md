This is our last science seminar of the Mexican Society
in which we have our first graduated PhD in Mathematics and an
interesting talk of LGBT Rights in Mexico.
The speakers are:
Frida Estrella, a second year PhD in Political Sciences and International Studies,
is going to speak about "An investigation into the ways that lesbian and bisexual
women negotiate dynamics within LGBT NGOs in Mexico", and
Cristina Villanueva, a recently graduated PhD in Pure Mathematics, who is going
to speak about "Counting to infinity and more in 20 minutes (ish)."

All are invited to attend the seminar on Thursday the 7th of December 2017,
18:00 hours at the Murray Learning Centre UG10.

The Science Seminars Series of the Mexican Society have the purpose
of doing networking for the current Mexicans and the International students
at University of Birmingham. Additionally to that,
the Science Seminars Series is a space where all are invited to share
any contribution to knowledge.
