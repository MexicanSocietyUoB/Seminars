# SOME POINTS

* Find attached the poster for the science seminars.
NB: when creating the event of the seminar on FaceBook,
would you please use the image of the poster as the main image of the event and
copy and paste the full message?

* Cristina is going to present her work on December. It should be in that month,
because she might leave Birmingham next year. I understand that some people
will be away on December. But I am sure that some people might be interested
in assisting the talk of Cristina and maybe Columba who has almost finished
her PhD in mathematics.
