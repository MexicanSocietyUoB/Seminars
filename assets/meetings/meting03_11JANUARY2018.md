MESSAGE FOR FACEBOOK

Science Seminars of the Mexican Society 2018

It has been great catching up with everyone regularly during our science
seminars in 2017 where we have had brilliant speakers from diverse areas and
different topics and interesting discussions and questions.

This time we want to announce the speakers for 2018 in the attached poster
and available here: https://mexicansocietyuob.github.io/seminars/seminars/talks/talks2018/

We invite anyone to assist and be part of the speakers and the audience
where we create a friendly environment and share knowledge.
So, if you have a conference presentation coming up, or are
working on a paper or other research idea you would like to give a
presentation on and get feedback about, please feel free to volunteer
to give a talk to our friendly audience!

Additionally, we are encouraging the scientific community to work towards
a reproducible and open science where anyone, anywhere can get the
benefits of science.

Help us to circulate the seminar series of the Mexican society for 2018.

ALL ARE INVITED TO ATTEND.
FREE ENTRANCE, (maybe) FREE MEXICAN SNACKS
