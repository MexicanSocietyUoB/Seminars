# CRISTINA VILLANUEVA

Cristina was born in Mexico City, where she completed her bachelor’s and master’s
degree in mathematics at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México.
Then she continued her studies in pure mathematics focusing her research in the
area of analysis.
She has recently finished her PhD in the University of Birmingham and now...
Well, right now she is still surprised that the last sentence is written in past
tense and in the very near future she will be dealing with the tougher question:
what can she do with a PhD in pure mathematics?
Apparently she can, at least, give a talk about infinity.
