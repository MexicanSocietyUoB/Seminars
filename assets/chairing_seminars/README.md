These are some easy steps to follow for the chair:

1. Read a short biography of the presenter.
2. Keep track of the time and show the presenter the "5 min to go" and
"2 min to go" notice before the end of the presentation.
3. Open the mic for questions and in case of no questions from the audience,
the chair should prepare some questions in advance.
4. Take photos to feed twitter with the user name, title and the hash tag for
the event.

For those who are assigned to be chairs, the following sources are very useful
to make a more professional and engaging session.
